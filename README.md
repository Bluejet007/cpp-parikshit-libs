# Matlab-C++ Library
The library contains a matrix class equivalent to common data structures used in **Matlab** by [*ADCS*](https://www.parikshitspace.in/subsystems/ADCS) of [Parikshit](https://www.parikshitspace.in/). The library is intended to be used in most *Matlab-C++* code conversion tasks for [*ODHS*](https://www.parikshitspace.in/subsystems/ODHS), greatly simplifying the process & improving code readability.
